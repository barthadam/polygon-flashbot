# Polygon Flashbot
 Bypass sweeper bot's and autowithdraw matic on a hacked wallet.

Claim airdrop or staked tokens on the polygon network and bypass sweeper bot's or autowithdraw MATIC on a hacked wallet.


<h2 tabindex="-1" class="heading-element" dir="auto">Use Case</h2>
<p dir="auto">The use case for this multi-transaction setup is to make calls from an account that has a compromised private key. Since transferring in any MATIC to this compromised wallet will immediately be swept by bots that monitor that account. 
Transferring in funds will also give any attacker the ability to withdraw tokens that are held by that account.</p>
